# Traditional-Feature-Extraction-Methods
Feature Extraction is an integral step for Image Processing jobs. This repository contains the python codes for Traditonal Feature Extraction Methods from an image dataset, namely Gabor, Haralick, Tamura, GLCM and GLRLM.
## Gabor filters:
In image processing, a Gabor filter, named after Dennis Gabor, is a linear filter used for edge detection. Frequency and orientation representations of Gabor filters are similar to those of the human visual system, and they have been found to be particularly appropriate for texture representation and discrimination. In the spatial domain, a 2D Gabor filter is a Gaussian kernel function modulated by a sinusoidal plane wave. Simple cells in the visual cortex of mammalian brains can be modeled by Gabor functions. Thus, image analysis with Gabor filters is thought to be similar to perception in the human visual system.
